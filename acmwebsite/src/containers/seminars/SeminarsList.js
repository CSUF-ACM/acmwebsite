    description: "The Eiffel Programming Language and EiffelIDE was designed by Bertrand Meyer in his classic text: " +
    "OBJECT-ORIENTED SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION.  It is used in industries where reliability and speed are critical, " +
    "including Aerospace, Banking/Finance, Manufacturing, and Telecom. One of its key aspects is Design by Contract, " +
    "a method of software construction that designs components of a system to cooperate using precise contracts, " +
    "with preconditions, postconditions, assertions and class/loop invariants to ensure the reliability of the " +
    "software created. Eiffel is an OO language that fully supports classes, inheritance and multiple inheritance, " +
    "abstract classes, polymorphism, dynamic binding, and generic programming. Eiffel has had SCOOP (Simple " +
    "Concurrent OOP) technology since 2011, which allows creating concurrent, OO programs, without having to use " +
    "threads, locks, condition variables, etc. In this talk, I will illustrate the use of these concepts in " +
    "improving the quality of software programs, and demonstrate the use of the EiffelStudio in creating quality " +
    "Object Oriented software on multiple platforms (OSX, Linux, and Windows)"
