                <p>
                    ACM (founded 1947) is an international scientific and educational organization dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology, serving both professional and public interests by fostering the open
                    interchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ethical standards. The Student Chapter of ACM at CSUF provides a continuing forum for the exchange of ideas and announcements for all the students on campus that share
                    an interest in the diversified aspects of computing.
